We would like to thank Piotr Dittwald for thourough introduction to the problem of fine isotopic structure and many productive brawls over proper definitions. We also thank Dirk Valkenborg for pointing out the existence of the concept of equatransneutronic isotopes. Finally, a huge thanks goes to prof. Alan Rockwood, for the time he has spent teaching me about his approach to tackle the problem of isotope calculations.
