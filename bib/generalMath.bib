	abstract = "This paper presents an iterative algorithm for the computation of the mode(s) of a Multinomial distribution. A real multiplicative factor x is searched for so that the integer part of x times the probabilities of occurrence vector is a mode. We define bounds on x which can be used to compute the new mode(s) for variations on the parameters of the Multinomial distribution. "
