We further investigate modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities to analyze integrability properties of Lipschitz functions on discrete spaces. In particular, we obtain, under modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, some concentration results for product measures that extend the classical exponential inequalities for sums of independent random variables.
