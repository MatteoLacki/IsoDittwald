{"}A comprehensive, up-to-date primer on the dynamics of growth theory and fiscal policy, written by two recognized experts in the field. For graduate students, researchers and policy-makers, this book illustrates how to harness solid economic theory in the service of cutting-edge debates about education, social security reform, and public debt management.{"} Costas Azariadis, University of California, Los Angeles  


{"}The overlapping generations model and the infinetly lived or dynastic model are the two workhorses of modern macroeconomics. De La Coix and Michel have written a wonderfully accessible graduate textbook on the overlapping generations model. They carefully take students through essentially every varient of the model, prove a large number of known results, and offer a few new ones as well. This book is an essential addition as a teaching tool and an invaluable reference on every economist's shelf.{"} V.V. Chari, University of Minnesota  


{"}In recent decades, overlapping generation models have become a central framework of analysis in the research of economic growth. The authors present a comprehensiv and lucid exposition of the dynamic structure of the basic overlapping generation features with production. Highly recommended for researchers and graduate students in the fields of growth theory and dynamic macroeconomics.{"} Oded Galor, Brown University  


{"}Some of the most hotly debated government policies are those that involve redistribution across generations, such as social security and public education. De la Croix and Michel provide a manual of economic tools for evaluating these sorts of policies based on simple overlapping generations models. Their presentation of these models strives to combine applicability for policy analysis with a solid foundation in dynamic general equilibrium theory. Their book should be of use to economists from the level of advanced undergraduate students to researchers and teachers.{"} Timothy J. Kehoe, University of Minnesota and Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  


{"}David de la Croix and Philippe Michel have written the definitive what's what study of economic growth and policy in the life-cycle growth model. Their book is a treasure for serious economists, both young and old.{"} Laurence J. Kotlikoff, Boston University  


{"}The overlapping generations model is a cornerstone of contemporary economic theory. De la Croix and Michel provide the first comprehensive textbook devoted to the analysis of these models. The book will be of considerable use to economists studying demographical economics, intergenerational fiscal policies, or more generally any issue related to long-run growth.{"} Gilles Saint-Paul, Université des Sciences Sociales de Toulouse 

\#\#\# Book Description

Inter-generational transfers are at the center of economic policy debates today. Reducing public debt, financing social security, taxing capital and bequests, and designing the education system all imply substantial inter-generational transfers. The tool economists employ to analyze these issues is the overlapping generations model, which models the different periods of life. When the model includes capital accumulation, it also allows researchers to formalize the development of an economy, relating its growth path to the savings behavior of young agents. The aim of this book is an in-depth treatment of this model including its major implications for policy.

    note = "Monetary Theory and Policy presents an advanced treatment of critical topics in monetary economics and the models economists use to investigate the interactions between real and monetary factors. It provides extensive coverage of general equilibrium models of money, models of the short-run real effects of monetary policy, and game-theoretic approaches to monetary policy. Among the topics covered are money-in-the-utility-function models, cash-in-advance models, money and public finance, the credit channel of money, models of time consistency, monetary policy operating procedures, and interest rates and monetary policy. The book uses dynamic simulations to evaluate quantitatively the significance of the channels through which monetary policy and inflation affect the economy. It extensively examines modern approaches to monetary policy that stress the incentives facing central banks and the strategic interactions between central banks and the private sector. Where most treatments of monetary policy emphasize money supply control and money demand, this book focuses on the implications of interest rate control for monetary policy. The book is designed for advanced graduate students in monetary economics, economic researchers, and economists working in policy institutions and central banks. This second edition includes new discussions of empirical evidence on the interest elasticity of money demand, the fiscal theory of the price level, the new Keynesian model, optimal policies in forward-looking models, stability and the Taylor principle, and open economy new Keynesian models. It also expands its coverage of multiple equilibria, the role of timing assumptions in cash-in-advance models, and the Ramsey approach to optimal monetary taxation. A new chapter treats policy analysis in new Keynesisan models; the discussion includes the derivation of the policy objective function, optimal commitment and discretionary outcome, targeting rules,and instrument rules.

\#\#\# From the Inside Flap

{"}Reading Daron Acemoglu's massive and masterly survey makes me feel like one of the Wright brothers coming face to face with a Boeing 747 for the first time. The range is enormous, from the simplest model to the political economy of growth, and everything is traced back to fundamentals with great skill and care. Being stranded on a desert island with this book and a large pad of paper would be a pleasure.{"}--Robert M. Solow, Nobel Laureate in Economics

{"}Daron Acemoglu's *Introduction to Modern Economic Growth* takes the reader on a fascinating journey to discover the foundations of major growth theories, from the neoclassical paradigm to the most recent endogenous growth models. This book is required reading for anyone who wants to master the fields of growth and development economics.{"}--Philippe Aghion, Harvard University

{"}This book is impressive in both its breadth and its depth. It offers an ideal access point to the current frontier in growth theory; readers will find a remarkably thorough treatment of all the key models and technical tools of dynamic macroeconomics. At the same time, real-world economic and policy issues always remain in sharp focus, thanks to a constant back-and-forth between theory, the most recent empirical studies, and the lessons of economic history. It will quickly become a much-thumbed book on the shelf of all those interested in growth, development, and macroeconomics.{"}--Roland J. M. Benabou, Princeton University

{"}This is much more than a textbook on growth theory; it is a milestone in macroeconomics. It provides a unified approach to the study of economic dynamics, including a rigorous yet teachable background in recursive methods and dynamic optimization, and an impressive range of macroeconomic topics. What is most fascinating is the tour of the state-of-the-art literature on long-run development to which the author has been a leading contributor.{"}--Fabrizio Zilibotti, University of Zurich

{"}An extraordinary achievement by an extraordinary intellect, this book provides a remarkably comprehensive overview of modern growth economics as well as a window into Daron Acemoglu's fundamentally important perspectives and insights. For years to come, it will be a cornerstone for advanced teaching and an invaluable resource for researchers. It represents economics at its most profound.{"}--Steven N. Durlauf, University of Wisconsin-Madison

{"}This book will be a landmark in growth economics. Its scope and depth are remarkable, and the benefits of this new synthesis are clear. Many of the chapters are likely to prompt ideas for further research, and the book will be a major event for researchers and graduate students alike.{"}--Jonathan Temple, University of Bristol

\#\#\# Book Description

This text is designed both for students of probability and stochastic processes, and for students of functional analysis. It presents some chosen parts of functional analysis that can help understand ideas from probability and stochastic processes. The subjects range from basic Hilbert and Banach spaces, through weak topologies and Banach algebras, to the theory of semigroups of bounded linear operators. Numerous standard and non-standard examples and exercises make the book suitable as a course textbook as well as for self-study.

Rudin's book, published in 1962, was the first to give a systematic account of these developments and has come to be regarded as a classic in the field. The basic facts concerning Fourier analysis and the structure of LCA groups are proved in the opening chapters, in order to make the treatment relatively self-contained.

{"}This book is a delightfully novel and thorough treatment of stochastic dynamic modeling. It builds on the well-known results as well as synthesizing the latest developments. Readers will find the many pictures and graphics as well as computer code and examples incredibly helpful. The book is beautifully written by a rapidly rising young star and is a must read for any economist and other researchers who want to learn the tools of dynamic stochastic modeling and apply these tools in their own research.{"} -- **William A. Brock**, Vilas Research Professor of Economics, The University of Wisconsin, Madison

{"}Graduate macroeconomics courses are becoming technically more sophisticated every year. Currently, there are very few books available that introduce the necessary mathematical techniques to understand modern macroeconomics and that are comprehensible to the non mathematician. John Stachurski's book helps fill this void. It is easy to read - conversational in tone - and yet it does not shy away from difficult material. But the book is more than just an introduction to dynamics for the mathematically challenged graduate student. It will also be an invaluable aid to the researcher as a reference book on stochastic dynamics.{"}--Roger Farmer, Department of Economics, UCLA

(Roger Farmer )  


{"}An invaluable monograph on stochastic dynamical systems that's ideally suited as a supplement for graduate courses in computational general equilibrium, macroeconomics, and asset pricing. The emphasis on economic illustrations and computational codes makes this volume a rich source of tools for students, instructors, and practitioners of economic dynamics.{"} **Costas Azariadis **, Mallinckrodt University Professor and Director, Center for Dynamic Economics, Washington University, St. Louis

{"}John Stachurski has written the book that convincingly links theoretical models of discrete time, nonlinear growth models, and the simulation and computation of the applications of these models. He makes these growth models accessible to researchers through the connection of theory and technique. Economic Dynamics covers foundational material useful for students and researchers. I highly recommend this book.{"} -- Leonard J. Mirman, Department of Economics, University of Virginia

This monograph provides a unified and comprehensive treatment of an order-theoretic fixed point theory in partially ordered sets and its various useful interactions with topological structures. It begins with a discussion of some simple examples of the order-theoretic fixed point results along with simple applications from each of the diverse fields. The fixed point theory is then developed and preliminary results on multi-valued variational inequalities regarding the topological and order-theoretical structure of solution sets are covered. This is followed by more advanced material which demonstrates the power of the developed fixed point theory. In the treatment of the applications a wide range of mathematical theories and methods from nonlinear analysis and integration theory are applied; an outline of which has been given in an appendix chapter to make the book self-contained.

Graduate students and researchers in nonlinear analysis, pure and applied mathematics, game theory and mathematical economics will find this book useful*.*

From the reviews: “The book is meant to be an introduction to the rich theory of nonparametric estimation through some simple models and examples. The detailed proofs given in the book will help the interested reader to understand the subject better. This well written book will be welcomed by all those interested in learning the presented concepts. The author should be complimented for a good treatise with detailed proofs of several important results in nonparametric estimation theory.” (Ravi Sreenivasan, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1176, 2010) “...A short and rigorous introduction to minimax results for estimators of densities and regression functions from independent observations. Each of the three chapters ends with a section containing detailed biographical notes and a section with exercises complementing and illustrating the main results. This book is an excellent introduction to the results and techniques of minimax estimation.” (Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 105, No. 489) “The potential reader of this book should be conversant with functional analysis and topology … . for a broad spectrum of mathematical statisticians, especially in the Continental Europe, this will be welcome as a good reading material. … attempts to formulate the basic theory of nonparametric functional estimation, including (i) construction of such estimators, (ii) their (asymptotic) statistical properties, (iii) optimality, in some sense, and (iv) adaptive estimation. The author contends to present the material … in a broad sense more acceptable to statisticians.” (Pranab K. Sen, International Statistical Review, Vol. 79 (2), 2011) 

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Methods of nonparametric estimation are located at the core of modern statistical science. The aim of this book is to give a short but mathematically self-contained introduction to the theory of nonparametric estimation. The emphasis is on the construction of optimal estimators; therefore the concepts of minimax optimality and adaptivity, as well as the oracle approach, occupy the central place in the book. This is a concise text developed from lecture notes and ready to be used for a course on the graduate level. The main idea is to introduce the fundamental concepts of the theory while maintaining the exposition suitable for a first approach in the field. Therefore, the results are not always given in the most general form but rather under assumptions that lead to shorter or more elegant proofs. The book has three chapters. Chapter 1 presents basic nonparametric regression and density estimators and analyzes their properties. Chapter 2 is devoted to a detailed treatment of minimax lower bounds. Chapter 3 develops more advanced topics: Pinsker's theorem, oracle inequalities, Stein shrinkage, and sharp minimax adaptivity.

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Measure theory is a classical area of mathematics that continues intensive development and has fruitful connections with most other fields of mathematics as well as important applications in physics. This book gives a systematic presentation of modern measure theory  as it has developed over the past century and offers three levels of presentation: a standard university graduate course, an advanced study containing some complements to the basic course (the material of this level corresponds to a variety of special courses), and, finally, more specialized topics partly covered by more than 850 exercises. Bibliographical and historical comments and an extensive bibliography with 2000 works covering more than a century are provided. Volume 1 is devoted to the classical theory of measure and integral. Whereas the first volume presents the ideas that go back mainly to Lebesgue, the second volume is to a large extent the result of the later development up to the recent years. The central subjects of Volume 2 are: transformations of measures, conditional measures, and weak convergence of measures. These topics are closely interwoven and form the heart of modern measure theory. The target readership includes graduate students interested in deeper knowledge of measure theory, instructors of courses in measure and integration theory, and researchers in all fields of mathematics. The book may serve as a source for many advanced courses or as a reference.

Composition operators form a simple but interesting class of operators having interactions with different branches of mathematics and mathematical physics.After an introduction, the book deals with these operators on Lp-spaces. This study is useful in measurable dynamics, ergodic theory, classical mechanics and Markov process. The composition operators on functional Banach spaces (including Hardy spaces) are studied in chapter III. This chapter makes contact with the theory of analytic functions of complex variables. Chapter IV presents a study of these operators on locally convex spaces of continuous functions making contact with topological dynamics. In the last chapter of the book some applications of composition operators in isometries, ergodic theory and dynamical systems are presented. An interesting interplay of algebra, topology, and analysis is displayed.This comprehensive and up-to-date study of composition operators on different function spaces should appeal to research workers in functional analysis and operator theory, post-graduate students of mathematics and statistics, as well as to physicists and engineers.

They deal with the symbiotic relationship between the theory of function spaces, harmonic analysis, linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, spectral theory and inverse problems. This book is a tribute to Hans Triebel's work on the occasion of his 65th birthday. It reflects his lasting influence in the development of the modern theory of function spaces in the last 30 years and its application to various branches in both pure and applied mathematics. Part I contains two lectures by O.V. Besov and D.E. Edmunds having a survey character and honouring Hans Triebel's contributions. The papers in Part II concern recent developments in the field presented by D.G. de Figueiredo / C.O. Alves, G. Bourdaud, V. Maz'ya / V. Kozlov, A. Miyachi, S. Pohozaev, M. Solomyak and G. Uhlmann. Shorter communications related to the topics of the conference and Hans Triebel's research are collected in Part III.

The book covers what constitutes the common core of control theory and is unique in its emphasis on foundational aspects. While covering a wide range of topics written in a standard theorem/proof style, it also develops the necessary techniques from scratch. In this second edition, new chapters and sections have been added, dealing with time optimal control of linear systems, variational and numerical approaches to nonlinear control, nonlinear controllability via Lie-algebraic methods, and controllability of recurrent nets and of linear systems with bounded controls.

The basic techniques and theorems of analysis are presented in such a way that the intimate connections between its various branches are strongly emphasized. The traditionally separate subjects of 'real analysis' and 'complex analysis' are thus united in one volume. Some of the basic ideas from functional analysis are also included. This is the only book to take this unique approach. The third edition includes a new chapter on differentiation. Proofs of theorems presented in the book are concise and complete and many challenging exercises appear at the end of each chapter. The book is arranged so that each chapter builds upon the other, giving students a gradual understanding of the subject.This text is part of the Walter Rudin Student Series in Advanced Mathematics.

Der zweite Band dieser Einführung in die Analysis behandelt die Integrationstheorie von Funktionen einer Variablen, die mehrdimensionale Differentialrechnung und die Theorie der Kurven und Kurvenintegrale. Der im ersten Band begonnene moderne und klare Aufbau wird konsequent fortgesetzt. Dadurch wird ein tragfähiges Fundament geschaffen, das es erlaubt, interessante Anwendungen zu behandeln, die zum Teil weit über den in der üblichen Lehrbuchliteratur behandelten Stoff hinausgehen. Dies betrifft beispielsweise die Behandlung von Nemytskiioperatoren, welche eine transparente Einführung in die Variationsrechnung und Herleitung der Euler-Lagrangeschen Gleichungen ermöglicht. Ein weiteres Beispiel stellt die Darstellung der lokalen Theorie der Untermannigfaltigkeiten des Rn dar. Als Anwendungen der Theorie der Kurvenintegrale werden die Cauchyschen Integralsätze und die Theorie der holomorphen Funktionen bis einschließlich der Homologieversion des Residuensatzes entwickelt. Neben der Berechnung wichtiger bestimmter Integrale der Mathematik und der Physik, werden funktionentheoretische Eigenschaften der Gamma- und der Riemannschen Zetafunktionen besprochen. Zahlreiche Übungsaufgaben von unterschiedlichem Schwierigkeitsgrad und viele informative Abbildungen runden dieses Lehrbuch ab.

It is full of historical nuggets, many of them surprising . . . The examples are especially helpful; if a particular topic seems difficult, a later example frequently tames it. The writing is refreshingly direct, never degenerating into a vocabulary lesson for its own sake. The book accomplishes the goals it has set for itself.

Methods of global analysis and stochastic analysis are most often applied in mathematical physics as separate entities, thus forming important directions in the field. However, while combination of the two subject areas is rare, it is fundamental for the consideration of a broader class of problems

This book develops methods of Global Analysis and Stochastic Analysis such that their combination allows one to have a more or less common treatment for areas of mathematical physics that traditionally are considered as divergent and requiring different methods of investigation

Global and Stochastic Analysis with Applications to Mathematical Physics covers branches of mathematics that are currently absent in monograph form. Through the demonstration of new topics of investigation and results, both in traditional and more recent problems, this book offers a fresh perspective on ordinary and stochastic differential equations and inclusions (in particular, given in terms of Nelson's mean derivatives) on linear spaces and manifolds. Topics covered include classical mechanics on non-linear configuration spaces, problems of statistical and quantum physics, and hydrodynamics

A self-contained book that provides a large amount of preliminary material and recent results which will serve to be a useful introduction to the subject and a valuable resource for further research. It will appeal to researchers, graduate and PhD students working in global analysis, stochastic analysis and mathematical physics

This book gives an excellent, almost complete account of the whole subject of probability in Banach spaces, a branch of probability theory that has undergone vigorous development... There is no doubt in the reviewer's mind that this book [has] become a classic.                                                                            MathSciNet As the authors state, {"}this book tries to present some of the main aspects of the theory of probability in Banach spaces, from the foundation of the topic to the latest developments and current research questions''.

Isoperimetric, measure concentration and random process techniques appear at the basis of the modern understanding of Probability in Banach spaces. Based on these tools, the book presents a complete treatment of the main aspects of Probability in Banach spaces (integrability and limit theorems for vector valued random variables, boundedness and continuity of random processes) and of some of their links to Geometry of Banach spaces (via the type and cotype properties). Its purpose is to present some of the main aspects of this theory, from the foundations to the most important achievements. The main features of the investigation are the systematic use of isoperimetry and concentration of measure and abstract random process techniques (entropy and majorizing measures). Examples of these probabilistic tools and ideas to classical Banach space theory are further developed.

The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus is developed, illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, which in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial economics. The book contains a detailed discussion of weak and strong solutions of stochastic differential equations and a study of local time for semimartingales, with special emphasis on the theory of Brownian local time. The whole is backed by a large number of problems and exercises.

\#\#\# Book Description

This book aims to bridge the gap between practicing mathematicians and the practitioners of turbulence theory. It presents the mathematical theory of turbulence to engineers and physicists, and the physical theory of turbulence to mathematicians. The book is the result of many years of research by the authors to analyze turbulence using Sobolev spaces and functional analysis.The mathematical technicalities are kept to a minimum within the book, enabling the language to be at a level understood by a borad audience. Each chapter is the accompanied by appendices giving full details of the mathematical proofs and subtleties. This unique presentation should ensure a volume of interest to mathematicians, engineers, and physicists.

This book’s title, Nonsmooth Mechanics and Analysis, refers to a major domain of mechanics, particularly those initiated by the works of Jean Jacques Moreau. Nonsmooth mechanics concerns mechanical situations with possible nondifferentiable relationships, eventually discontinuous, as unilateral contact, dry friction, collisions, plasticity, damage, and phase transition. The basis of the approach consists in dealing with such problems without resorting to any regularization process. Indeed, the nonsmoothness is due to simplified mechanical modeling; a more sophisticated model would require too large a number of variables, and sometimes the mechanical information is not available via experimental investigations. Therefore, the mathematical formulation becomes nonsmooth; regularizing would only be a trick of arithmetic without any physical justification. Nonsmooth analysis was developed, especially in Montpellier, to provide specific theoretical and numerical tools to deal with nonsmoothness. It is important not only in mechanics but also in physics, robotics, and economics.   Audience This book is intended for researchers in mathematics and mechanics.

Tyrrell Rockafellar's classic study presents readers with a coherent branch of nonlinear mathematical analysis that is especially suited to the study of optimization problems. Rockafellar's theory differs from classical analysis in that differentiability assumptions are replaced by convexity assumptions. The topics treated in this volume include: systems of inequalities, the minimum or maximum of a convex function over a convex set, Lagrange multipliers, minimax theorems and duality, as well as basic results about the structure of convex sets and the continuity and differentiability of convex functions and saddle- functions. This book has firmly established a new and vital area not only for pure mathematics but also for applications to economics and engineering. A sound knowledge of linear algebra and introductory real analysis should provide readers with sufficient background for this book.

From its origins in the minimization of integral functionals, the notion of 'variations' has evolved greatly in connection with applications in optimization, equilibrium, and control. It refers not only to constrained movement away from a point, but also to modes of perturbation and approximation that are best describable by 'set convergence', variational convergence of functions and the like. This book develops a unified framework and, in finite dimension, provides a detailed exposition of variational geometry and subdifferential calculus in their current forms beyond classical and convex analysis. Also covered are set-convergence, set-valued mappings, epi-convergence, duality, maximal monotone mappings, second-order subderivatives, measurable selections and normal integrands. The changes in this 3rd  printing mainly concern various typographical corrections, and reference omissions that came to light in the previous printings. Many of these reached the authors' notice through their own re-reading, that of their students and a number of colleagues mentioned in the Preface. The authors also included a few telling examples as well as improved a few statements, with slightly weaker assumptions or have strengthened the conclusions in a couple of instances.

From the reviews: “This book is devoted to the theory of inverse and implicit functions and some of its modifications for solution mappings in variational problems. … The book is targeted to a broad audience of researchers, teachers and graduate students. It can be used as well as a textbook as a reference book on the topic. Undoubtedly, it will be used by mathematicians dealing with functional and numerical analysis, optimization, adjacent branches and also by specialists in mechanics, physics, engineering, economics, and so on.” (Peter Zabreiko, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1178, 2010) “The book starts with the classical framework of implicit function theorem and then is largely focusing on properties of solution mapping of variational problems. … The book ends with a rich list of references, a glossary of notation, and a subject index. This references reflect from one side the authors’s contribution to this topic and from other side the contributions of many other researchers all over the world. Certainly this wonderful work will be included in many libraries all over the world.” (Marian Mureşan, Studia Universitatis Babes-Bolyai, Mathematica, Vol. LV (4), December, 2010) “The present monograph will be a most welcome and valuable addition. … This book will save much time and effort, both for those doing research in variational analysis and for students learning the field. This important contribution fills a gap in the existing literature.” (Stephen M. Robinson, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2010 g) “The book commences with a helpful context-setting preface followed by six chapters. Each chapter starts with a useful preamble and concludes with a careful and instructive commentary, while a good set of references, a notation guide, and a somewhat brief index complete this study. … I unreservedly recommended this book to all practitioners and graduate students interested in modern optimization theory or control theory or to those just engaged by beautiful analysis cleanly described.” (Jonathan Michael Browein, IEEE Control Systems Magazine, February, 2012) 

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

The implicit function theorem is one of the most important theorems in analysis and its many variants are basic tools in partial differential equations and numerical analysis. This book treats the implicit function paradigm in the classical framework and beyond, focusing largely on properties of solution mappings of variational problems. The purpose of this self-contained work is to provide a reference on the topic and to provide a unified collection of a number of results which are currently scattered throughout the literature. The first chapter of the book treats the classical implicit function theorem in a way that will be useful for students and teachers of undergraduate calculus. The remaining part becomes gradually more advanced, and considers implicit mappings defined by relations other than equations, e.g., variational problems. Applications to numerical analysis and optimization are also provided. This valuable book is a major achievement and is sure to become a standard reference on the topic.

The authors of this book have undertaken the approach of presenting real industrial problems and their mathematical modeling as a motivation for developing mathematical methods that are needed for solving the problems. With each chapter presenting one important problem that arises in today's industry, and then studying the problem by mathematical analysis and computation, this book introduces the reader to many new ideas and methods from ordinary and partial differential equations, and from integral equations and control theory. It brings the excitement of real industrial problems into the undergraduate mathematical curriculum.

Is it a good investment, statistically speaking!{"} (Book Review Editor, Technometrics, August 2009, VOL. 51, NO. 3) From the reviews of the second edition: {"}This second edition pays tribute to the many developments in recent years in this field, and new material was added to several existing chapters as well as four new chapters … were included. … These additions make this book worthwhile to obtain … . In general this is a well written book which gives a good overview on statistical learning and can be recommended to everyone interested in this field. The book is so comprehensive that it offers material for several courses.{"} (Klaus Nordhausen, International Statistical Review, Vol. 77 (3), 2009) 

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.

{"}Barro and Sala-i-Martin have done a superb job of synthesizing much of the existing theoretical and empirical research on the mechanisms and determinants of economic growth and convergence. Though it incorporates much new material, this updated version is fully accessible to a third year undergraduate student, while remaining of invaluable use to any research scholar seriously interested in growth and development economics.{"}--Philippe Aghion, Department of Economics, Harvard University

{"}Barro and Sala-i-Martin provide an outstanding and comprehensive treatment of growth theory and empirics—an instant classic! I learn something new every time I pull my copy from the shelf.{"} **Charles I. Jones **, Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley

{"}Laurence Kotlikoff is the world's leading authority on savings behavior: its causes and its consequences for public policy. These essays are a worthy successor and extension to his What Determines Savings? Anyone who wants to stay current on research in public finance will want to read the recent contributions collected here.{"}--Robert E. Lucas, Jr., John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor, The University of Chicago, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences (1995)Please note: {"}What Determines Savings?{"} is in italics.

{"}Dalia Marin and Monika Schnitzer have produced the first serious theory of barter in emerging market economies. Using the methodology and techniques of modern contract theory, they show how barter trade can mitigate contractual enforcement problems in relationships involving moral hazard in technology trade and debt repayments. They also provide an illuminating analysis of barter in transition economies where firms are both highly credit-constrained and operating in a non-competitive environment with a small number of suppliers and customers. This book will become a classical reference in the fields of transition, international trade and international finance, and also for all students and researchers interested in economic development and institutions.{"}--Philippe Aghion, Department of Economics, Harvard University

{"}Lionel McKenzie's new monograph is a pleasure to read. Only a major contributor to economic theory could teach general equilibrium theory with such clarity and authority. The book is gracefully written and rigorous, and does an elegant job of situating competitive equilibrium theory in the economic and mathematical traditions from which it evolved.{"}--Robert E. Lucas, Jr., John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor, The University of Chicago, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences (1995)

{"}Barro and Sala-i-Martin provide an outstanding and comprehensive treatment of growth theory and empirics -- an instant classic! I learn something new every time I pull my copy from the shelf.{"}--Charles I. Jones, Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley

{"}*Contract Theory* is certainly the most important textbook on the frontiers of microeconomics since Tirole's celebrated *Theory of Industrial Organization*. Bolton and Dewatripont have done a marvelous job of providing an exhaustive account of the field, using only very simple and self-contained models and relying on a whole battery of economic applications. All this contributes to making the book not only the unavoidable teaching and research reference on contract theory, but also a unique tribute to economics at its best.{"}--Philippe Aghion, Department of Economics, Harvard University

It introduces a simple and useful setup which enables the polynomial time solution of broad fundamental classes of nonlinear combinatorial optimization and integer programming problems in variable dimension. An important part of this theory is enhanced by recent developments in the algebra of Graver bases. The power of the theory is demonstrated by deriving the first polynomial time algorithms in a variety of application areas within operations research and statistics, including vector partitioning, matroid optimization, experimental design, multicommodity flows, multi-index transportation and privacy in statistical databases.

Former National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Kissinger discusses the art of diplomacy and the American approach to foreign affairs.   
Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc. 

\#\#\# From Library Journal

After nearly a dozen books and service as secretary of state for presidents Nixon and Ford, Kissinger has established himself as a major thinker, writer, and actor on the world's diplomatic stage. His newest work is a remarkable survey of the craft of international relations from the early 17th century to the present era. Beginning with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, Kissinger summarizes three centuries of Western diplomacy, giving special attenton to the influence of Wilsonian idealism on 20th-century American foreign policy. He is not shy about describing his own contributions to Nixon's foreign gambits, nor is he reticient about offering his own advice to the current administration on how to handle Russia, China, or the rest of the world. From Kissinger we learn that there is really little new about the New World Order. This is an important contribution to the theoretical literature on foreign affairs and will also serve quite ably as a one-volume synthesis of modern diplomatic history. All libraries should have this impressive book. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 12/93.

    note = "\#\#\# Amazon.com Review

Fully revised and beefed up with plenty of new material on today's Standard C++, the new edition of Bruce Eckel's *Thinking in C++: Volume I* is an excellent tutorial to mastering this rich (and sometimes daunting) programming language, filled with expert advice and written in a patient, knowledgeable style.

The effective presentation, along with dozens of helpful code examples, make this book a standout. The text first sets the stage for using C++ with a tour of what object-oriented programming is all about, as well as the software design life cycle. The author then delves into every aspect of C++, from basic keywords and programming principles to more advanced topics, like function and operator overloading, virtual inheritance, exception handling, namespaces, and templates. C++ is a complex language, and the author covers a lot of ground using today's Standard C++, but without getting bogged down in excessive detail. 

The emphasis here is on practical programming, so there's basic advice on using header files, preprocessor directives, and namespaces to organize code effectively. Each chapter ends with exercises (usually about two dozen), and the entire text of the book is available on the accompanying CD-ROM. (So is the second volume, which tours Standard C++ classes and other advanced topics.)

Whether you have read the first edition of this book or not, there is much to mine from *Thinking in C++*. This new version continues to set a high standard as an approachable and thorough tutorial. *--Richard Dragan*

**Topics covered**: Introduction to objects, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, exception handling, analysis and design fundamentals, advantages of C++, transitioning from C, compiling and building programs, writing C++ functions, flow control, C++ operators, data types, casting, debugging tips, pointers to functions, designing reusable C++ classes, conditional compilation and header files, access specifiers, constructors and destructors, function overloading and default arguments, using *const* and *static* effectively, inlining, namespaces, references, copy constructors, operator overloading, using *new* and *delete* for dynamic objects, virtual functions, abstract classes, introduction to templates, and iterators. 

\#\#\# Review

{"}This book is a tremendous achievement. You owe it to yourself to have a copy on your shelf. The chapter on iostreams is the most comprehensive and understandable treatment of that subject I've seen to date.{"} - Al Stevens Contributing Editor, Doctor Dobbs Journal {"}Eckel's book is the only one to so clearly explain how to rethink program construction for object orientation. That the book is also an excellent tutorial on the ins and outs of C++ is an added bonus.{"} - Andrew Binstock, Editor, Unix Review {"}Bruce continues to amaze me with his insight into C++, and Thinking in C++ is his best collection of ideas yet. If you want clear answers to difficult questions about C++, buy this outstanding book.{"} - Gary Entsminger Author, The Tao of Objects {"}Thinking in C++ patiently and methodically explores the issues of when and how to use inlines, references, operator overloading, inheritance and dynamic objects, as well as advanced topics such as the proper use of templates, exceptions and multiple inheritance. The entire effort is woven in a fabric that includes Eckel's own philosophy of object and program design. A must for every C++ developer's bookshelf, Thinking in C++ is the one C++ book you must have if you're doing serious development with C++.{"} - Richard Male Shaw Contributing Editor, PC Magazine

A fellow of Trinity College Cambridge, Maxwell became, in 1871, the first Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge. His famous equations - a set of four partial differential equations that relate the electric and magnetic fields to their sources, charge density and current density - first appeared in fully developed form in his 1873 Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. This two-volume textbook brought together all the experimental and theoretical advances in the field of electricity and magnetism known at the time, and provided a methodical and graduated introduction to electromagnetism. Volume 1 covers the first elements of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory: electrostatics, and electrokinematics, including detailed analyses of electrolysis, conduction in three dimensions, and conduction through heterogeneous media.

`An excellent text....The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succint manner.' - American Scientist, from a review of the First Edition 

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Reviews from the First Edition: {"}An excellent text … The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succinct manner.{"} (American Scientist) {"}No matter how gently one introduces students to the concept of Dirac’s bras and kets, many are turned off. Shankar attacks the problem head-on in the first chapter, and in a very informal style suggests that there is nothing to be frightened of.{"} (Physics Bulletin) Reviews of the Second Edition: {"}This massive text of 700 and odd pages has indeed an excellent get-up, is very verbal and expressive, and has extensively worked out calculational details---all just right for a first course. The style is conversational, more like a corridor talk or lecture notes, though arranged as a text. … It would be particularly useful to beginning students and those in allied areas like quantum chemistry.{"} (Mathematical Reviews)   R. Shankar has introduced major additions and updated key presentations in this second edition of Principles of Quantum Mechanics. New features of this innovative text include an entirely rewritten mathematical introduction, a discussion of Time-reversal invariance, and extensive coverage of a variety of path integrals and their applications. Additional highlights include: - Clear, accessible treatment of underlying mathematics - A review of Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics - Student understanding of quantum theory is enhanced by separate treatment of mathematical theorems and physical postulates - Unsurpassed coverage of path integrals and their relevance in contemporary physics The requisite text for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level students, Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition is fully referenced and is supported by many exercises and solutions. The book’s self-contained chapters also make it suitable for independent study as well as for courses in applied disciplines.

A magnificent work that is bound to have immense influence on the ways economists think about dynamic systems for many years to come. My own guess is that this book will eventually acquire the stature, say, of Hicks's *Value and Capital* or Samuelson's *Foundations*.  
--Thomas J. Sargent, Hoover Institution  


The book is a *tour de force*. The authors present a unified approach to the techniques and applications of recursive economic theory. The presentations of discrete-time dynamic programming and of Markov processes are authoritative. There is a wide-ranging series of examples drawn from all branches of the discipline, but with special emphasis on macroeconomics. In the short run, the book will be a vital reference in any advanced course in macroeconomic theory. In the long run, it may help to remove the traditional boundaries between microeconomic theory and macroeconomic theory.  
--Andrew Caplin, Columbia University  


This book is a wonderful collection of results on the techniques of dynamic programming with great applications to economics written by giants in the field.

Praise for the previous edition: {"}This is an innovative graduate textbook that develops much of modern macroeconomics in the framework of stochastic general equilibrium models. The book is especially good for its integration of macro and finance.{"}--Christopher Pissarides, London School of Economics and Political Science

Praise for the previous edition: {"}There are very few good textbooks on the dynamic general equilibrium approach to macroeconomics; *Macroeconomic Theory* fills a big void and provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to the subject that covers both real and monetary models. Professor Wickens develops a series of topics, beginning with real models of the economy and proceeding through growth, fiscal policy, financial models, and the modern approach to monetary economies. Each topic begins with theoretical background and proceeds to practical applications. The level is appropriate for master's or advanced undergraduate students and is a welcome addition to the field that is likely to be widely adopted.{"}--Roger E. A. Farmer, University of California, Los Angeles

Praise for the previous edition: {"}A most welcome graduate (or advanced undergraduate) textbook in macroeconomics. The book is well written and the text is effectively organized and progresses in a natural and easy-to-follow way. The text offers a mathematical approach that is easily accessible to the students. The technical level is sufficiently detailed to allow students to understand the role of the underlying assumptions and how the models work, and yet it avoids unnecessary technicalities and sidetracks. As an extra bonus, it offers a treatment of financial aspects which are often neglected in macro textbooks.{"}--Torben M. Andersen, University of Aarhus, Denmark

Praise for the previous edition: {"}Wickens's text provides a tremendous introduction to modern macroeconomics. The coverage of material is thorough. The writing is clear and lively. The mathematics is sufficiently detailed without being overly technical, and the mathematical appendix helps keep the text largely self-contained. Intuition behind key results is provided beautifully throughout. Having worked through the text, students will be well-equipped for a journey toward the macroeconomics frontier.{"}--David N. DeJong, University of Pittsburgh

Praise for the previous edition: {"}This is a first-rate book that definitely helps fill a surprising lacuna in graduate macro teaching.{"}--Andrew Scott, London Business School

Praise for the previous edition: {"}This book provides an integrated, self-contained, and accessible exposition of modern macroeconomic theory. Particular strengths include coverage of macroeconomic approaches to asset pricing and the analysis of monetary and fiscal policies. It is an excellent textbook for students in masters and PhD courses and an excellent reference for professional economists.{"}--Philip Lane, Trinity College Dublin

{"}Eine ausführliche Darstellung des lnhalts der vorliegenden fünften Auflage dieser beispielhaften Einführung in die Funktionalanalysis erübrigt sich durch die Besprechungen der früheren Auflagen … Neu ist ein Abschnitt über Fixpunktsätze im Kapitel IV. Dabei werden auch die notwendigen Resultate über gleichmäßig konvexe Banachräume gesammelt. ...

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Jetzt in der siebten, korrigierten und erweiterten Auflage - Das Lehrbuch für Mathematiker und Physiker, die eine leicht lesbare und gründliche Einführung in die Funktionalanalysis suchen. Aus den Besprechungen: {"}... Durch den ökonomischen Aufbau (neun Kapitel, die von normierten Räumen bis zu lokalkonvexen Räumen und Banachalgebren reichen) gelingt es dem Autor, ungewöhnlich viel Material auf engem Raum unterzubringen und die Darstellung dennoch locker zu halten. Hilberträume werden erst relativ spät eingeführt (so daß die tiefen Einbettungssätze von Sobolev und Rellich vor der Definition der Orthogonalität kommen), aber dadurch wird fast jede Redundanz vermieden. Besonders hervorzuheben sind die Teile über Spektralzerlegung und die Einführung in die Distributionen. Zweihundert Übungsbeispiele sowie Anhänge über Maßtheorie und Topologie erleichtern das Selbststudium. Ausgezeichnet auch die historischen Bemerkungen und Ausblicke am Schluß jedes Kapitels, die auch neueste Ergebnisse berücksichtigen.{"} Monatshefte für Mathematik {"}Bei dem Springer-Lehrbuch {"}Funktionalanalysis{"} von Dirk Werner handelt es sich um einen sehr schönen, gut geschriebenen einführenden Band, der auch Basis von Vorlesungen sein kann, Dozenten und Studierenden als Nachschlagewerk dienen mag und von dem sich Teile als Grundlage für Funktionalanalysis-Seminare verwenden lassen. Das Buch deckt den gesamten {"}klassischen{"} Stoff einer zweisemestrigen Funktionalanalysis-Vorlesung für Diplom-Mathematiker und -Physiker sowie Lehramtskandidaten ab, bietet aber mehr: Es setzt Akzente, wie man sie bei anderen Einführungen in die Funktionalanalysis bisher nicht oder nicht in diesem Umfang gefunden hat. Generell liegen die Stärken des Buches in den vielen durchgerechneten Beispielen und Anwendungen; dazu gibt es in jedem der neun Kapitel einen Abschnitt mit interessanten Übungen. Die jedes Kapitel abschließenden {"}Bemerkungen und Ausblicke{"} sind besonders willkommen: Hier geht der Autor mit viel Perspektive auf die Problemgeschichte, weiteren Stoff, neuere Entwicklungen u.ä. ein.{"} Zentralblatt für Mathematik

This is the exciting and highly literate story of the real Lawrence of Arabia, as written by Lawrence himself, who helped unify Arab factions against the occupying Turkish army, circa World War I. Lawrence has a novelist's eye for detail, a poet's command of the language, an adventurer's heart, a soldier's great story, and his memory and intellect are at least as good as all those. Lawrence describes the famous guerrilla raids, and train bombings you know from the movie, but also tells of the Arab people and politics with great penetration. Moreover, he is witty, always aware of the ethical tightrope that the English walked in the Middle East and always willing to include himself in his own withering insight.

Starred Review. Those readers who have found post–cold war le Carré too cerebral will have much to cheer about with this Russian mafia spy thriller. While on holiday in Antigua, former Oxford tutor Perry Makepiece and his lawyer girlfriend, Gail Perkins, meet Dmitri {"}Dima{"} Vladimirovich Krasnov, an avuncular Russian businessman who challenges Perry to a tennis match. Even though Perry wins, Dima takes a shine to the couple, and soon they're visiting with his extended family. At Dima's request, Perry conveys a message to MI6 in England that Dima wishes to defect, and on arriving home, Perry and Gail receive a summons from MI6 to a debriefing. Not only is Dima a Russian oligarch, he's also one of the world's biggest money launderers. Le Carré ratchets up the tension step-by-step until the sad, inevitable end. His most accessible work in years, this novel shows once again why his name is the one to which all others in the field are compared.

Much to the dismay of many longtime fans, le Carré chose to keep up with the times after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yet, despite his shift from Cold War-era espionage to more contemporary themes, le Carré's signature stark prose, pitch-perfect dialogue, authentic characters, and moral indignation have stood the test of time. The critics were pleased to see {"}the master{"} (*Telegraph*) back in action, but some had reservations: While the *Guardian* lamented the {"}long, fussily narrated opening,{"} the *Scotsman* praised *Traitor*'s {"}long and elegantly paced plot.{"} Others quibbled about some dubious plot devices and cartoonish villains, but these complaints paled beside {"}the old magic{"} (*Telegraph*). Intriguing and tense, *Traitor* shines a blinding, angry, and welcome light on shady international finances and underhanded intelligence agents.

{"}...thought provoking and [a] valuable addition to the scientific community. The author, Judea Pearl, is not only an expert but also well known for creating novel ideas in cognitive system analysis and artificial intelligence...It is a well-composed an written book. The bibliography is exhaustive and up-to-date. I enjoyed thoroughly reading the material in the book. I would highly recommend this book to both theoretical and applied scientists.{"}   
Journal of statistical Computation and Simulation  


{"}Without assuming much beyond elementary probability theory, Judea Pearl's book provides an attractive tour of recent work, in which he has played a central role, on causal models and causal reasoning. Due to his efforts, and that of a few others, a Renaissance in thinking and using causal concepts is taking place.{"}   
Patrick Suppes, Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University  


{"}For philosophers of science with a serious interest in casual modeling, Causality is simply mandatory reading.{"}   
Philosophical Review  


{"}This highly original book will change the way social science researchers think about causality for years to come. Pearl has produced a new and powerful formal theory of causal analysis that will be great use to the serious empirical researcher. A must read.{"}   
Christopher Winship, Department of Sociology, Harvard University  


{"}Judea Pearl's previous book, Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems, was arguably the most influential book in Artificial Intelligence in the past decade, setting the stage for much of the current activity in probabilistic reasoning. In this book, Pearl turns his attention to causality, boldly arguing for the primacy of a notion long ignored in statistics and misunderstood and mistrusted in other disciplines, from physics to economics. He demystifies the notion, clarifies the basic concepts in terms of graphical models, and explains the source of many misunderstandings. This book should prove invaluable to researchers in artificial intelligence, statistics, economics, epidemiology, and philosophy, and, indeed, all those interested in the fundamental notion of causality. It may well prove to be one of the most influential books of the next decade.{"}   
Joseph Halpern, Computer Science Department, Cornell University  


{"}Judea Pearl has come to statistics and causation with enthusiasm and creativity. His work is always thought provoking and worth careful study. This book proves to be no exception. Time and again I found myself disagreeing both with his assumptions and with his conclusions, but I was also fascinated by new insights into problems I thought I already understood well. This book illustrates the rich contributions Pearl has made to statistical literature and to our collective understanding of models for causal reasoning.{"}   
Stephen Fienberg, Maurice Falk University Professor of Statistics and Social Science, Carnegie Mellon University  


{"}This book on causal inference by a brilliant computer scientist will both delight and inform all--philosophers, psychologists, epidemiologists, computer scientists, lawyers--who appreciate the intriguing problem of causation posed by David Hume more than two and a half centuries ago.{"}   
Patricia Cheng, Department of Pyschology, University of California, Los Angeles  


{"}This book fulfills a long-standing need for a rigorous yet accessible treatise on the mathematics of causal inference. Judea Pearl has done a masterful job of describing the most important approaches and displaying their underlying logical unity. The book deserves to be read by all statisticians and scientists who use nonexperimental data to study causation, and would serve well as a graduate or advanced undergraduate course text.{"}   
Sander Greenland, UCLA School of Public Health  


{"}Judea Pearl has written an account of recent advances in the modeling of probability and cause, substantial parts of which are due to him and his co-workers. This is essential reading for anyone interested in causality.{"} Brian Skyrms, Department of Philosophy, University of California, Irvine  


{"}In conclusion, make no mistake about it: This is an important book. Even if almost all of the content has appeared previously in diverse venues, it has been brought together here for all of us to think about.{"}

\#\#\# Book Description

Causality offers the first comprehensive coverage of causal analysis in many sciences, including recent advances using graphical methods. Pearl presents a unified account of the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual and structural approaches to causation, and devises simple mathematical tools for analyzing the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will facilitate the incorporation of causal analysis as an integral part of the standard curriculum in statistics, business, epidemiology, social science and economics. Causality will be of interest to professionals and students in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences.

It presents the field of population genetics, starting with elementary concepts and leading the reader well into the field. It is concerned mainly with population genetics in a strict sense and deals primarily with natural populations and less fully with the rather similar problems that arise in breading livestock and cultivated plans. The emphasis is on the behavior of genes and population attributes under natural selection where the most important measure is Darwinian fitness. This text is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in genetics and population biology This book steers a middle course between completely verbal biological arguments and the rigor of the mathematician. The first two-thirds of the book do not require advanced mathematical background. An ordinary knowledge of calculus will suffice. The latter parts of the book, which deal with population stochastically, use more advanced methods. Chapter Titles: 1.Models of population growth. 2.Randomly mating populations. 3.Inbreeding. 4.Correlation between relatives and assertive mating. 5.Selection. 6.Populations in approximate equilibrium. 7.Properties of a finite population. 8.Stochastic processes in the change of gene frequencies. 9.Distribution of gene frequencies in populations.

A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and theirproperties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective.Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed,including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevancevector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesianframework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets arediscussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets areavailable on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markovprocesses.

    note = "This much-needed book on the design of algorithms and data structures for text processing emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical applications. It is intended to serve both as a textbook for courses on algorithm design, especially those related to text processing, and as a reference for computer science professionals. The work takes a unique approach, one that goes more deeply into its topic than other more general books. It contains both classical algorithms and recent results of research on the subject. The book is the first text to contain a collection of a wide range of text algorithms, many of them quite new and appearing here for the first time. Other algorithms, while known by reputation, have never been published in the journal literature. Two such important algorithms are those of Karp, Miller and Rosenberg, and that of Weiner. Here they are presented together for the fist time. The core of the book is the material on suffix trees and subword graphs, applications of these data structures, new approaches to time-space optimal string-matching, and text compression. Also covered are basic parallel algorithms for text problems. Applications of all these algorithms are given for problems involving data retrieval systems, treatment of natural languages, investigation of genomes, data compression software, and text processing tools. From the theoretical point of view. the book is a goldmine of paradigms for the development of efficient algorithms, providing the necessary foundation to creating practical software dealing with sequences. A crucial point in the authors' approach is the development of a methodology for presenting text algorithms so they can be fully understood. Throughout, the book emphasizes the efficiency of algorithms, holding that the essence of their usefulness depends on it. This is especially important since the algorithms described here will find application in {"}Big Science{"} areas like molecular sequence analysis where the explosive growth of data has caused problems for the current generation of software. Finally, with its development of theoretical background, the book can be considered as a mathematical foundation for the analysis and production of text processing algorithms.

One of the most useful books on understanding cooking, kind of like a rock-and-roll version of Harold McGee's {"}On Food and Cooking.{"} -*The Washington Post*

In his enchanting, funny, and informative book, Cooking for Geeks (O'Reilly), Jeff Potter tells us why things work in the kitchen and why they don't. *-NY Daily News*

Potter covers an array of topics, including {"}calibrating your equipment{"} in the kitchen, gastronomy, genetically modified foods, understanding pH levels, temperature, and the psychology of taste, while giving readers a refresher in chemistry that is both accessible and (dare I say) fun. *-The New Yorker's Book Bench*

Clear, fact-packed, and engaging ... Cooking for Geeks offers an improbable victory of text over the standard food porn.* -The Atlantic*

\#\#\# About the Author

A science and food geek, Jeff Potter has been featured on television newscasts and radio shows throughout the country, spoken at science festivals both in the United States and overseas, and is a trustee and spokesperson for Awesome Food, part of the Awesome Foundation. He studied computer science and visual art at Brown University.

From the reviews: {"}This textbook is an introduction to fine path-properties of real Lévy processes with a view towards applications. … it is written in a more pedagogical tone, with many exercises for which answers are given. … This monograph is mainly intended as a textbook for graduate students, as the author says in the introduction, but it should also be useful for researchers wishing to become better acquainted with the fluctuation theory of Lévy processes, and its applications.{"} (Thomas D.

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Lévy processes are the natural continuous-time analogue of random walks and form a rich class of stochastic processes around which a robust mathematical theory exists. Their mathematical significance is justified by their application in many  areas of classical and modern stochastic models including storage models, renewal processes, insurance risk models, optimal stopping problems, mathematical finance and continuous-state branching processes. This text book forms the basis of a graduate course on the theory and applications of Lévy processes, from the perspective of their path fluctuations. Central to the presentation are decompositions of the paths of Lévy processes in terms of their local maxima and an understanding of their short- and long-term behaviour. The book aims to be mathematically rigorous while still providing an intuitive feel for underlying principles. The results and applications often focus on the case of Lévy processes with jumps in only one direction, for which recent theoretical advances have yielded a higher degree of mathematical transparency and explicitness. Each chapter has a comprehensive set of exercises with complete solutions.

'This excellent textbook by L. Breiman, which was used by many people to learn probability and which was out of print for some years, is again available as an unchanged republication. It gives an introduction to probability based on measure theory.' F. Hofbauer, Monatschefte für Mathematik  


'A reprint of the 1986 Addison-Wesley text, long out of print (TR, October 1968). This is one of the true classics in the field of probability and its reappearance is welcome. At this price it belongs on the shelf of every student and professional in the area.' American Mathematical Monthly  


'The style of writing is very informal and chatty. With a few exceptions this goes over quite well. Though one might reproach the author with an undue haste in keeping the reader's attention, and in skimming the cream of many subjects, the overall effect is good and may to some extent alleviate the discouragement of many non-specialists who want a reasonably modern account not overly encumbered with heavy analytic and set-theoretic preliminaries.' D. A. Darling, Mathematical Reviews  


'This book is written on an advanced graduate level and addresses statisticians, engineers, and mathematicians who are interested in probability theory and measure and function theory.' Ion A. Craciun, Recenzii 

\#\#\# Book Description

This reprint volume is an excellent introduction to mathematical probability theory, suitable for graduate-level use in probability courses or as a supplement for courses in stochastic processes or mathematical statistics. The readability and clarity of the style help students understand why things work, instead of handing them a theorem-proof regime.

Following a brief introduction and overview, early chapters cover the basic algebraic relationships of entropy, relative entropy and mutual information, AEP, entropy rates of stochastics processes and data compression, duality of data compression and the growth rate of wealth. Later chapters explore Kolmogorov complexity, channel capacity, differential entropy, the capacity of the fundamental Gaussian channel, the relationship between information theory and statistics, rate distortion and network information theories. The final two chapters examine the stock market and inequalities in information theory. In many cases the authors actually describe the properties of the solutions before the presented problems. 

\#\#\# From the Inside Flap

Elements of Information Theory is an up-to-date introduction to the field of information theory and its applications to communication theory, statistics, computer science, probability theory, and the theory of investment. Covering all the essential topics in information theory, this comprehensive work provides an accessible introduction to the field that blends theory and applications. In step-by-step detail, the authors introduce the basic quantities of entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information and show how they arise as natural answers to questions of data compression, channel capacity, rate distortion, hypothesis testing, information flow in networks, and gambling. In addition, Elements of Information Theory investigates a number of ideas never before covered at this level in a textbook, including:  
* The relationship of the second law of thermodynamics to Markov chains  
* Competitive optimality of Huffman codes  
* The duality of data compression and gambling  
* Lempel Ziv coding  
* Kolmogorov complexity  
* Portfolio theory  
* Inequalities in information theory and their consequences in mathematics  
Complete with numerous illustrations, original problems and historical notes, Elements of Information Theory is a practical reference for communications professionals and statisticians specializing in information theory. It also serves as an excellent introductory text for senior and graduate students taking courses in telecommunications, electrical engineering, statistics, computer science, and economics.

--P. B. Gove, *Webster's Third New International Dictionary *(1961)

This is the first of a series of updates that I plan to make available at regular intervals as I continue working toward the ultimate editions of *The Art of Computer Programming.*

I was inspired to prepare fascicles like this by the example of Charles Dickens, who issued his novels in serial form; he published a dozen installments of *Oliver Twist* before having any idea what would become of Bill Sikes! I was thinking also of James Murray, who began to publish 350-page portions of the *Oxford English Dictionary* in 1884, finishing the letter B in 1888 and the letter C in 1895. (Murray died in 1915 while working on the letter T; my task is, fortunately, much simpler than his.)

Unlike Dickens and Murray, I have computers to help me edit the material, so that I can easily make changes before putting everything together in its final form. Although I'm trying my best to write comprehensive accounts that need no further revision, I know that every page brings me hundreds of opportunities to make mistakes and to miss important ideas. My files are bursting with notes about beautiful algorithms that have been discovered, but computer science has grown to the point where I cannot hope to be an authority on all the material I wish to cover. Therefore I need extensive feedback from readers before I can finalize the official volumes.

In other words, I think these fascicles will contain a lot of Good Stuff, and I'm excited about the opportunity to present everything I write to whoever wants to read it, but I also expect that beta-testers like you can help me make it Way Better. As usual, I will gratefully pay a reward of $2.56 to the first person who reports anything that is technically, historically, typographically, or politically incorrect.

Charles Dickens usually published his work once a month, sometimes once a week; James Murray tended to finish a 350-page installment about once every 18 months. My goal, God willing, is to produce two 128-page fascicles per year.Most of the fascicles will represent new material destined for Volumes 4 and higher; but sometimes I will be presenting amendments to one or more of the earlier volumes. For example, Volume 4 will need to refer to topics that belong in Volume 3, but weren't invented when Volume 3 first came out. With luck, the entire work will make sense eventually.

Fascicle Number One is about MMIX, the long-promised replacement for MIX. Thirty-seven years have passed since the MIX computer was designed, and computer architecture has been converging during those years towards a rather different style of machine. Therefore I decided in 1990 to replace MIX with a new computer that would contain even less saturated fat than its predecessor.

Exercise 1.3.1-25 in the first three editions of Volume 1 spoke of an extended MIX called MixMaster, which was upward compatible with the old version. But MixMaster itself has long been hopelessly obsolete. It allowed for several gigabytes of memory, but one couldn't even use it with ASCII code to print lowercase letters. And ouch, its standard conventions for calling subroutines were irrevocably based on self-modifying instructions! Decimal arithmetic and self-modifying code were popular in 1962, but they sure have disappeared quickly as machines have gotten bigger and faster. Fortunately the modern RISC architecture has a very appealing structure, so I've had a chance to design a new computer that is not only up to date but also fun.

Many readers are no doubt thinking, {"}Why does Knuth replace MIX by another machine instead of just sticking to a high-level programming language? Hardly anybody uses assemblers these days.{"} Such people are entitled to their opinions, and they need not bother reading the machine-language parts of my books. But the reasons for machine language that I gave in the preface to Volume 1, written in the early 1960s, remain valid today: 

  * One of the principal goals of my books is to show how high-level constructions are actually implemented in machines, not simply to show how they are applied. I explain coroutine linkage, tree structures, random number generation, high-precision arithmetic, radix conversion, packing of data, combinatorial searching, recursion, etc., from the ground up.

  * The programs needed in my books are generally so short that their main points can be grasped easily.

  * People who are more than casually interested in computers should have at least some idea of what the underlying hardware is like. Otherwise the programs they write will be pretty weird.

  * Machine language is necessary in any case, as output of some of the software that I describe.

  * Expressing basic methods like algorithms for sorting and searching in machine language makes it possible to carry out meaningful studies of the effects of cache and RAM size and other hardware characteristics (memory speed, pipelining, multiple issue, lookaside buffers, the size of cache blocks, etc.) when comparing different schemes.

Moreover, if I did use a high-level language, what language should it be? In the 1960s I would probably have chosen Algol W; in the 1970s, I would then have had to rewrite my books using Pascal; in the 1980s, I would surely have changed everything to C; in the 1990s, I would have had to switch to C++ and then probably to Java. In the 2000s, yet another language will no doubt be *de rigueur*. I cannot afford the time to rewrite my books as languages go in and out of fashion; languages aren't the point of my books, the point is rather what you can do in your favorite language. My books focus on timeless truths.

Therefore I will continue to use English as the high-level language in *The Art of Computer Programming*, and I shall continue to use a low-level language to indicate how machines actually compute. Readers who only want to see algorithms that are already packaged in a plug-in way, using a trendy language, should buy other people's books.

The good news is that programming for MMIX is pleasant and simple. This fascicle presents

1) a programmer's introduction to the machine (replacing Section 1.3.1 of the third edition of Volume 1);

2) the MMIX assembly language (replacing Section 1.3.2);

3) new material on subroutines, coroutines, and interpretive routines (replacing Sections 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3).

Of course, MIX appears in many places throughout the existing editions of Volumes 1--3, and dozens of programs need to be rewritten for MMIX before the next editions of those volumes are ready. Readers who would like to help with this conversion process are encouraged to join the MMIXmasters, a happy group of volunteers based at mmixmasters.sourceforge.net.

The fourth edition of Volume 1 will not be ready until after Volumes 4 and 5 have been completed; therefore two quite different versions of Sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3 will coexist for several years. In order to avoid potential confusion, I've temporarily assigned {"}prime numbers{"} 1.3.1', 1.3.2',1.4.1', 1.4.2', and 1.4.3' to the new material.

I am extremely grateful to all the people who helped me with the design of MMIX. In particular, John Hennessy and Richard L. Sites deserve special thanks for their active participation and substantial contributions. Thanks also to Vladimir Ivanovic for volunteering to be the MMIX grandmaster/webmaster.

A series of anecdotes shouldn't by rights add up to an autobiography, but that's just one of the many pieces of received wisdom that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman (1918-88) cheerfully ignores in his engagingly eccentric book, a bestseller ever since its initial publication in 1985. Fiercely independent (read the chapter entitled {"}Judging Books by Their Covers{"}), intolerant of stupidity even when it comes packaged as high intellectualism (check out {"}Is Electricity Fire?{"}), unafraid to offend (see {"}You Just *Ask* Them?{"}), Feynman informs by entertaining. It's possible to enjoy *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman* simply as a bunch of hilarious yarns with the smart-alecky author as know-it-all hero. At some point, however, attentive readers realize that underneath all the merriment simmers a running commentary on what constitutes authentic knowledge: learning by understanding, not by rote; refusal to give up on seemingly insoluble problems; and total disrespect for fancy ideas that have no grounding in the real world. Feynman himself had all these qualities in spades, and they come through with vigor and verve in his no-bull prose. No wonder his students--and readers around the world--adored him. *--Wendy Smith*

\#\#\# From Publishers Weekly

History will remember Nobel Prize–winning physicist Feynman (1918–1988), for his work in quantum physics and his role in the investigation of the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. Contemporary readers and listeners, however, will remember him best for his reputation as a free-thinking iconoclast whose personal adventures were hilarious, insightful and inspiring. Todd does a fabulous job of conveying Feynman's infectious enthusiasm and childlike sense of wonder with his energetic portrayal of the scientist. He's adept even in difficult sections, such as when Feynman {"}speaks Italian{"} and {"}Chinese{"}—inventing completely made-up but accurate sounding languages. Todd does a good job of portraying Feynman's inquisitive manner and conveys the book's message and attitude with aplomb. While he sounds nothing like the late physicist (Feynman— the subject of James Gleick's *Genius—*had a thick Long Island accent and sounded more like a cross between Yogi Bear and *The Honeymooners*' Ed Norton), Todd's clean, polite voice is a revelation. *Based on the Norton paperback.

    note = "A crucial challenge for economists is figuring out how people interpret the world and form expectations that will likely influence their economic activity. Inflation, asset prices, exchange rates, investment, and consumption are just some of the economic variables that are largely explained by expectations. Here George Evans and Seppo Honkapohja bring new explanatory power to a variety of expectation formation models by focusing on the learning factor. Whereas the rational expectations paradigm offers the prevailing method to determining expectations, it assumes very theoretical knowledge on the part of economic actors. Evans and Honkapohja contribute to a growing body of research positing that households and firms learn by making forecasts using observed data, updating their forecast rules over time in response to errors. This book is the first systematic development of the new statistical learning approach. Depending on the particular economic structure, the economy may converge to a standard rational-expectations or a {"}rational bubble{"} solution, or exhibit persistent learning dynamics. The learning approach also provides tools to assess the importance of new models with expectational indeterminacy, in which expectations are an independent cause of macroeconomic fluctuations. Moreover, learning dynamics provide a theory for the evolution of expectations and selection between alternative equilibria, with implications for business cycles, asset price volatility, and policy. This book provides an authoritative treatment of this emerging field, developing the analytical techniques in detail and using them to synthesize and extend existing research.

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

The book provides graduate students and researchers with an up-to-date survey of statistical and econometric techniques for the analysis of count data, with a focus on conditional distribution models. Proper count data probability models allow for rich inferences, both with respect to the stochastic count process that generated the data, and with respect to predicting the distribution of outcomes. The book starts with a presentation of the benchmark Poisson regression model. Alternative models address unobserved heterogeneity, state dependence, selectivity, endogeneity, underreporting, and clustered sampling. Testing and estimation is discussed from frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Finally, applications are reviewed in fields such as economics, marketing, sociology, demography, and health sciences. The fifth edition contains several new topics, including copula functions, Poisson regression for non-counts, additional semi-parametric methods, and discrete factor models. Other sections have been reorganized, rewritten, and extended.

<:;st> The first edition (1980) is one of the 10 titles on quantitative genetics/population genetics cited in *BCL3*. For upper-level undergraduates and beginning graduate students with some background in genetics and population biology. Contains nine chapters with illustrations, boxed examples and problems. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or. 

\#\#\# Review

It is a pleasure to read this new edition of a classical textbook on population genetics. It shows very convincingly how population genetics has been revamped in the past 20 years by the introduction of new statistical and computational methods (in particular, coalescent theory), and the advent of genomic data, as well as how these developments changed a formerly rather arcane science and moved it toward the center of modern biology. … In summary, the essence of population genetics is nicely condensed in this book. The presentation is wonderfully balanced between theory and observation, as well as classical and recent data sets and analysis tools. --Wolfgang Stephan, The Quarterly Review of Biology

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Advances in computers and biotechnology have had a profound impact on biomedical research, and as a result complex data sets can now be generated to address extremely complex biological questions. Correspondingly, advances in the statistical methods necessary to analyze such data are following closely behind the advances in data generation methods. The statistical methods required by bioinformatics present many new and difficult problems for the research community. This book provides an introduction to some of these new methods. The main biological topics treated include sequence analysis, BLAST, microarray analysis, gene finding, and the analysis of evolutionary processes. The main statistical techniques covered include hypothesis testing and estimation, Poisson processes, Markov models and Hidden Markov models, and multiple testing methods. The second edition features new chapters on microarray analysis and on statistical inference, including a discussion of ANOVA, and discussions of the statistical theory of motifs and methods based on the hypergeometric distribution. Much material has been clarified and reorganized. The book is written so as to appeal to biologists and computer scientists who wish to know more about the statistical methods of the field, as well as to trained statisticians who wish to become involved with bioinformatics. The earlier chapters introduce the concepts of probability and statistics at an elementary level, but with an emphasis on material relevant to later chapters and often not covered in standard introductory texts. Later chapters should be immediately accessible to the trained statistician. Sufficient mathematical background consists of introductory courses in calculus and linear algebra. The basic biological concepts that are used are explained, or can be understood from the context, and standard mathematical concepts are summarized in an Appendix. Problems are provided at the end of each chapter allowing the reader to develop aspects of the theory outlined in the main text. Warren J. Ewens holds the Christopher H. Brown Distinguished Professorship at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of two books, Population Genetics and Mathematical Population Genetics. He is a senior editor of Annals of Human Genetics and has served on the editorial boards of Theoretical Population Biology, GENETICS, Proceedings of the Royal Society B and SIAM Journal in Mathematical Biology. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and the Australian Academy of Science. Gregory R. Grant is a senior bioinformatics researcher in the University of Pennsylvania Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory. He obtained his Ph.D. in number theory from the University of Maryland in 1995 and his Masters in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1999. Comments on the first edition: {"}This book would be an ideal text for a postgraduate course…[and] is equally well suited to individual study…. I would recommend the book highly.{"} (Biometrics) {"}Ewens and Grant have given us a very welcome introduction to what is behind those pretty [graphical user] interfaces.{"} (Naturwissenschaften) {"}The authors do an excellent job of presenting the essence of the material without getting bogged down in mathematical details.{"} (Journal American Statistical Association) {"}The authors have restructured classical material to a great extent and the new organization of the different topics is one of the outstanding services of the book.{"} (Metrika)

This edition provides a prose rendering of *The Epic of Gilgamesh*, the cycle of poems preserved on clay tablets surviving from ancient Mesopotamia of the third mi llennium B.C. One of the best and most important pieces of epic poetry from human history, predating even Homer's Iliad by roughly 1,500 years, the Gilgamesh epic tells of the various adventures of that hero-king, including his quest for immortality, and an account of a great flood similar in many details to the Old Testament's story of Noah. The translator also provides an interesting and useful introduction explaining much about the historical context of the poem and the archeological discovery of th e tablets.

\#\#\# Book Description

Distribution theory consists of those areas of probability theory that are useful in understanding the development of statistical methodology, with the focus on the calculation and approximation of probabilities and moments. This detailed introduction uses no measure theory, making it suitable for students in statistics and econometrics as well as for researchers who use statistical methods. Topics range from the basic distribution and density functions, expectation, conditioning, characteristic functions, cumulants, convergence in distribution and the central limit theorem to more advanced concepts such as exchangeability, orthogonal polynomials, and saddlepoint approximations.

The book covers both the classical one-dimensional case as well as finite- and infinite-dimensional settings. All the main topics at the heart of the subject are introduced in a systematic fashion so that in the final chapter even the most recent developments in the theory can be understood. The treatment is geared toward applications. The presentation concentrates on the probabilistic and statistical aspects of extreme values such as limiting results, domains of attraction and development of estimators without emphasizing related topics such as point processes, empirical distribution functions and Brownian motion. An appendix on regular variation has been added since some required results in that area are not available in book form. The usefulness of the statistical theory is shown by treating several case studies in detail. The book is a thorough, accessible, self-contained, graduate level treatment of modern extreme value theory and some of its applications. It is aimed at graduate students and researchers and requires only maturity in mathematics and statistics.

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Proteomics is the study of the subsets of proteins present in different parts of an organism and how they change with time and varying conditions. Mass spectrometry is the leading technology used in proteomics, and the field relies heavily on bioinformatics to process and analyze the acquired data.   Since recent years have seen tremendous developments in instrumentation and proteomics-related bioinformatics, there is clearly a need for a solid introduction to the crossroads where proteomics and bioinformatics meet.

*Computational Methods for Mass Spectrometry* *Proteomics* describes the different instruments and methodologies used in proteomics in a unified manner. The authors put an emphasis on the computational methods for the different phases of a proteomics analysis, but the underlying principles in protein chemistry and instrument technology are also described. The book is illustrated by a number of figures and examples, and contains exercises for the reader. Written in an accessible yet rigorous style, it is a valuable reference for both informaticians and biologists.

*Computational Methods for Mass Spectrometry* *Proteomics* is suited for advanced undergraduate and graduate students of bioinformatics and molecular biology with an interest in proteomics. It also provides a good introduction and reference source for researchers new to proteomics, and for people who come into more peripheral contact with the field.

Yet right from chapter 1, the author succeeds in explaining in an intellectually exciting way what the cell does and what degrees of freedom enable it to function. … The book proceeds with detailed discussions of some of the key network motifs, circuit-element designs … [and] focuses on concrete examples such as chemotaxis and developmental pattern formation. … He draws the detailed strands together into an appealing and inspiring overview of biology. … One final aspect that must be mentioned is the wonderful set of exercises that accompany each chapter. … Alon’s book should become a standard part of the training of graduate students in biological physics… .{"}

{"}…a superb, beautifully written and organized work that takes an engineering approach to systems biology. Alon provides nicely written appendices to explain the basic mathematical and biological concepts clearly and succinctly without interfering with the main text. He starts with a mathematical description of transcriptional activation and then describes some basic transcription-network motifs (patterns) that can be combined to form larger networks. … Alon investigates networks at a higher level, including genomic regulatory networks. He does an excellent job of explaining and motivating a useful toolbox of engineering models and methods using network-based controls. … will be a valuable and non-overlapping addition to a systems-biology curriculum.{"}

\#\# THE FIFTH EDITION OF ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS

*Econometric Analysis* is intended for a one-year graduate course in econometrics for social scientists. The prerequisites for this course should include calculus, mathematical statistics, and an introduction to econometrics at the level of, say, *Gujarati's Basic Econometrics* (McGraw-Hill, 1995) or Wooldridge's *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* South-Western (2000). Self-contained (for our purposes) summaries of the matrix algebra, mathematical statistics, and statistical theory used later in the book are given in Appendices A through D. Appendix E contains a description of numerical methods that will be useful to practicing econometricians. The formal presentation of econometrics begins with discussion of a fundamental pillar, the linear multiple regression model, in Chapters 2 through 8. Chapters 9 through 15 present familiar extensions of the single linear equation model, including nonlinear regression, panel data models, the generalized regression model, and systems of equations. The linear model is usually not the sole technique used in most of the contemporary literature. In view of this, the (expanding) second half of this book is devoted to topics that will extend the linear regression model in many directions. Chapters 16 through 18 present the techniques and underlying theory of estimation in econometrics, including GMM and maximum likelihood estimation methods and simulation based techniques. We end in the last four chapters, 19 through 22, with discussions of current topics in applied econometrics, including time-series analysis and the analysis of discrete choice and limited dependent variable models. 

This book has two objectives. The first is to introduce students to *applied econometrics,* including basic techniques in regression analysis and some of the rich variety of models that are used when the linear model proves inadequate or inappropriate. The second is to present students with sufficient *theoretical background* that they will recognize new variants of the models learned about here as merely natural extensions that fit within a common body of principles. Thus, I have spent what might seem to be a large amount of effort explaining the mechanics of GMM estimation, nonlinear least squares, and maximum likelihood estimation and GARCH models. To meet the second objective, this book also contains a fair amount of theoretical material, such as that on maximum likelihood estimation and on asymptotic results for regression models. Modern software has made complicated modeling very easy to do, and an understanding of the underlying theory is important. 

I had several purposes in undertaking this revision. As in the past, readers continue to send me interesting ideas for my {"}next edition.{"} It is impossible to use them all, of course. Because the five volumes of the *Handbook of Econometrics* and two of the *Handbook of Applied Econometrics* already run to over 4,000 pages, it is also unnecessary. Nonetheless, this revision is appropriate for several reasons. First, there are new and interesting developments in the field, particularly in the areas of microeconometrics (panel data, models for discrete choice) and, of course, in time series, which continues its rapid development. Second, I have taken the opportunity to continue fine-tuning the text as the experience and shared wisdom of my readers accumulates in my files. For this revision, that adjustment has entailed a substantial rearrangement of the material—the main purpose of that was to allow me to add the new material in a more compact and orderly way than I could have with the table of contents in the 4th edition. The 15terature in econometrics has continued to evolve, and my third objective is to grow with it. This purpose is inherently difficult to accomplish in a textbook. Most of the literature is written by professionals for other professionals, and this textbook is written for students who are in the early stages of their training. But I do hope to provide a bridge to that literature, both theoretical and applied. 

This book is a broad survey of the field of econometrics. This field grows continually, and such an effort becomes increasingly difficult. (A partial list of journals devoted at least in part, if not completely, to econometrics now includes the *Journal of Applied Econometrics, Journal of Econometrics, Econometric Theory, Econometric Reviews, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, Empirical Economics,* and *Econometrica.*) Still, my view has always been that the serious student of the field must start somewhere, and one *can* successfully seek that objective in a single textbook. This text attempts to survey, at an entry level, enough of the fields in econometrics that a student can comfortably move from here to practice or more advanced study in one or more specialized areas. At the same time, I have tried to present the material in sufficient generality that the reader is also able to appreciate the important common foundation of all these fields and to use the tools that they all employ. 

There are now quite a few recently published texts in econometrics. Several have gathered in compact, elegant treatises, the increasingly advanced and advancing theoretical background of econometrics. Others, such as this book, focus more attention on applications of econometrics. One feature that distinguishes this work from its predecessors is its greater emphasis on nonlinear models. Davidson and MacKinnon (1993) is a noteworthy, but more advanced, exception. Computer software now in wide use has made estimation of nonlinear models as routine as estimation of linear ones, and the recent literature reflects that progression. My purpose is to provide a textbook treatment that is in fine with current practice. The book concludes with four lengthy chapters on time-series analysis, discrete choice models and limited dependent variable models. These nonlinear models are now the staples of the applied econometrics literature. This book also contains a fair amount of material that will extend beyond many first courses in econometrics, including, perhaps, the aforementioned chapters on limited dependent variables, the section in Chapter 22 on duration models, and some of the discussions of time series and panel data models. Once again, I have included these in the hope of providing a bridge to the professional literature in these areas. 

I have had one overriding purpose that has motivated all five editions of this work. For the vast majority of readers of books such as this, whose ambition is to use, not develop econometrics, I believe that it is simply not sufficient to recite the theory of estimation, hypothesis testing and econometric analysis. Understanding the often subtle background theory is extremely important. But, at the end of the day, my purpose in writing this work, and for my continuing efforts to update it in this now fifth edition, is to show readers how to *do* econometric analysis. I unabashedly accept the unflattering assessment of a correspondent who once likened this book to a {"}user's guide to econometrics.{"} 

\#\#\# SOFTWARE AND DATA

There are many computer programs that are widely used for the computations described in this book. All were written by econometricians or statisticians, and in general, all are regularly updated to incorporate new developments in applied econometrics. A sampling of the most widely used packages and Internet home pages where you can find information about them are: 

  * *E-Views*—www.eviews.com (QMS, Irvine, Calif.)
  * *Gauss*—www.aptech.com (Aptech Systems, Kent, Wash.)
  * *LIMDEP*—www.limdep.com (Econometric Software, Plainview, N.Y)
  * *RATS*—www.estima.com (Estima, Evanston, Ill.)
  * *SAS*—www.sas.com (SAS, Cary, N.C.)
  * *Shazam*—shazam.econ.ubc.ca (Ken White, UBC, Vancouver, B.C.)
  * *Stata*—www.stata.com (Stata, College Station, Tex.)
  * *TSP*—www.tspintl.com (TSP International, Stanford, Calif)

Programs vary in size, complexity, cost, the amount of programming required of the user, and so on. Journals such as *The American Statistician, The Journal of Applied Econometrics,* and *The Journal of Economic Surveys* regularly publish reviews of individual packages and comparative surveys of packages, usually with reference to particular functionality such as panel data analysis or forecasting. 

With only a few exceptions, the computations described in this book can be carried out with any of these packages. We hesitate to link this text to any of them in particular. We have placed for general access a customized version of *LIMDEP,* which was also written by the author, on the website for this text, **www.prenhall.com/greene**. *LIMDEP* programs used for many of the computations are posted on the sites as well. 

The data sets used in the examples are also on the website. Throughout the text, these data sets are referred to {"}TableFn.m,{"} for example Table F4.1. The F refers to Appendix F at the back of the text, which contains descriptions of the data sets. The actual data are posted on the website with the other supplementary materials for the text. (The data sets are also replicated in the system format of most of the commonly used econometrics computer programs, including in addition to *LIMDEP, SAS, TSP, SPSS, E-Views,**Stata,* so that you can easily import them into whatever program you might be using.) 

I should also note, there are now thousands of interesting websites containing software, data sets, papers, and commentary on econometrics. It would be hopeless to attempt any kind of a survey here. But, I do note one which is particularly agreeably structured and well targeted for readers of this book, the data archive for the *Journal of Applied Econometrics.* This journ...

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

As every chemist knows, there is a direct (if complex) relationship between the molecular structure of a compound and its chemical behavior. Predicting such behavior is possible by an abstract representation of its structure in terms of chemical similarity parameters, so-called 'descriptors'. These are most useful in predicting the pharmacological properties of drug candidates, but are also used in predicting reactivity, toxicity and other important chemical characteristics.  
The number-one reference on the topic now contains a wealth of new data: The entire relevant literature over the past six years has been painstakingly surveyed, resulting in more than 100 new descriptors being added to the list, and some 3,000 new references in the bibliography section.   
Volume 1 contains an alphabetical listing of around 3300 terms for the chemoinformatic analysis of chemical compound properties, while the second volume contains 6343 references selected from 450 journals with about 7000 authors quoted covering the period from the beginning of molecular descriptor research until the year 2008.   
In this second edition, the greatly expanded introductory section has been completely re-written and now contains several {"}walk-through{"} reading lists of selected keywords to make the data even more accessible for novice users.

Monte Carlo Simulation in Statistical Physics deals with the computer simulation of many-body systems in condensed-matter physics and related fields of physics, chemistry and beyond, to traffic flows, stock market fluctuations, etc.). Using random numbers generated by a computer, probability distributions are calculated, allowing the estimation of the thermodynamic properties of various systems. This book describes the theoretical background to several variants of these Monte Carlo methods and gives a systematic presentation from which newcomers can learn to perform such simulations and to analyze their results. The fifth edition covers Classical as well as Quantum Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore a new chapter on the sampling of free-energy landscapes has been added. To help students in their work a special web server has been installed to host programs and discussion groups (http://wwwcp.tphys.uni-heidelberg.de). Prof. Binder was awarded the Berni J. Alder CECAM Award for Computational Physics 2001 as well as the Boltzmann Medal in 2007.

From the reviews:

{"}This book is one in the Graduate Texts in Mathematics series published by Springer. … There is a variety of worked examples as well as 350-plus exercises … . The book is a valuable addition to the literature on Fourier analysis. It is written with more mathematical rigour than many texts … without being totally opaque to the non-specialist. … The examples at the end of each chapter are well structured and a reader working through most of them will achieve a good understanding of the topics.{"} (Graham Brindley, The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 90 (517), 2006)

{"}The author … presents the results of his experiences and choices for decades of teaching courses. … The tables and formulas collected … are of great service. At the end of each chapter there is a summary section that discusses the results, gives some history, and suggests instructive exercises. We thus have a solid course on Fourier analysis and its applications interesting for students and specialists in engineering as well as for mathematicians. … I believe that the book will find numerous interested readers.{"} (Elijah Liflyand, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1032 (7), 2004)

{"}This book is an interesting mixture of a traditional approach … and a more modern one, emphasizing the role of (tempered) distributions and the application aspects of Fourier analysis. … The book is certainly highly recommendable for those who want to learn the essence of Fourier analysis in a mathematically correct way without having to go through too much technical details.{"} (H.G. Feichtinger, Monatshefte für Mathematik, Vol. 143 (2), 2004)

{"}The book is appropriate for an advanced undergraduate or a master’s level one-term introductory course on Fourier series with applications to boundary value problems. … a deep idea is presented in a non-rigorous way both to show the usefulness of the idea and to stimulate interest in further study. … The book has a good collection of exercises … . Each chapter ends with both a summary of its main results and methods and historical notes.{"} (Colin C. Graham, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2004 e)

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

This book presents the basic ideas in Fourier analysis and its applications to the study of partial differential equations. It also covers the Laplace and Zeta transformations and the fundaments of their applications. The author has intended to make his exposition accessible to readers with a limited background, for example, those not acquainted with the Lebesgue integral or with analytic functions of a complex variable. At the same time, he has included discussions of more advanced topics such as the Gibbs phenomenon, distributions, Sturm-Liouville theory, Cesaro summability and multi-dimensional Fourier analysis, topics which one usually will not find in books at this level.

Many of the chapters end with a summary of their contents, as well as a short historical note. The text contains a great number of examples, as well as more than 350 exercises. In addition, one of the appendices is a collection of the formulas needed to solve problems in the field.

Anders Vretblad is Senior Lecturer of Mathematics at Uppsala University, Sweden.

Originally published in 1986, this valuable reference provides a detailed treatment of limit theorems and inequalities for empirical processes of real-valued random variables. This book is appropriate for researchers in statistical theory, probability theory, biostatistics, econometrics, and computer science. 

\#\#\# From the Publisher

Here is the first book to summarize a broad cross-section of the large volume of literature available on one-dimensional empirical processes. Presents a thorough treatment of the theory of empirical processes, with emphasis on real random variable processes as well as a wide-ranging selection of applications in statistics. Featuring many tables and illustrations accompanying the proofs of major results, coverage includes foundations--special spaces and special processes, convergence and distribution of empirical processes, alternatives and processes of residuals, integral tests of fit and estimated empirical processes, and martingale methods.

{"}It will give readers the confidence that their estimates of variance are tractable, and they can therefore use quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration to do the software engineering tradeoff analysis that is critical to professional software project management and architecture. This textbook--and believe me, it is a textbook--will lead students to a deep understanding of the potential errors that can be expected.{"}   
Larry Bernstein, Computing Reviews  


{"}This book provides a self-contained and comprehensive exposition of one of the most attractive techniques for numerical integration, the so-called quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) rule. As well-known specialists in the field, the authors have made a tour de force to include, systematize, and unify their achievements and an impressive number of results of other people. By introducing the concepts and methods in an accessible and intuitive form, the authors have provided a useful book that is accompanied by a lot of illustrative examples, graphics and applications.{"}   
Petru P. Blaga, Mathematical Reviews 

\#\#\# Book Description

Students will find this book indispensable as it introduces high-dimensional numerical integration and discrepancy theory from scratch with hundreds of examples and exercises. It also includes the newest results on quasi-Monte Carlo, digital nets and sequences, and discrepancy, making it an invaluable reference for researchers.

    note = "This text provides an introduction to ergodic theory suitable for readers knowing basic measure theory. The mathematical prerequisites are summarized in Chapter 0. It is hoped the reader will be ready to tackle research papers after reading the book. The first part of the text is concerned with measure-preserving transformations of probability spaces; recurrence properties, mixing properties, the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, isomorphism and spectral isomorphism, and entropy theory are discussed. Some examples are described and are studied in detail when new properties are presented. The second part of the text focuses on the ergodic theory of continuous transformations of compact metrizable spaces. The family of invariant probability measures for such a transformation is studied and related to properties of the transformation such as topological traitivity, minimality, the size of the non-wandering set, and existence of periodic points. Topological entropy is introduced and related to measure-theoretic entropy. Topological pressure and equilibrium states are discussed, and a proof is given of the variational principle that relates pressure to measure-theoretic entropies. Several examples are studied in detail. The final chapter outlines significant results and some applications of ergodic theory to other branches of mathematics.

From the reviews:

{"}By providing an overall survey of results obtained so far in a very readable manner, and also presenting some new ideas, this well-written book will appeal to academic researchers in the field of HMMs, with PhD students working on related topics included. It will also appeal to practitioners and researchers from other fields by guiding them through the computational steps needed for making inference HMMs and/or by providing them with the relevant underlying statistical theory. In the reviewer's opinion this book will shortly become a reference work in its field.{"} *MathSciNet*

{"}This monograph is a valuable resource. It provides a good literature review, an excellent account of the state of the art research on the necessary theory and algorithms, and ample illustrations of numerous applications of HMM. It goes much beyond the earlier resources on HMM...I anticipate this work to serve well many *Technometrics *readers in the coming years.{"} *Haikady N. Nagaraja for Technometrics, November 2006*

{"}This monograph is an attempt to present a reasonably complete up-to-date picture of the field of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) that is self-contained from a theoretical point of view and self sufficient from a methodological point of view. … The book is written for academic researchers in the field of HMMs, and also for practitioners and researchers from other fields. … all the theory is illustrated with relevant running examples. This voluminous book has indeed the potential to become a standard text on HMM.{"} (R. Schlittgen, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1080, 2006)

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Hidden Markov models have become a widely used class of statistical models with applications in diverse areas such as communications engineering, bioinformatics, finance and many more. This book is a comprehensive treatment of inference for hidden Markov models, including both algorithms and statistical theory. Topics range from filtering and smoothing of the hidden Markov chain to parameter estimation, Bayesian methods and estimation of the number of states.

In a unified way the book covers both models with finite state spaces, which allow for exact algorithms for filtering, estimation etc. and models with continuous state spaces (also called state-space models) requiring approximate simulation-based algorithms that are also described in detail. Simulation in hidden Markov models is addressed in five different chapters that cover both Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo approaches. Many examples illustrate the algorithms and theory. The book also carefully treats Gaussian linear state-space models and their extensions and it contains a chapter on general Markov chain theory and probabilistic aspects of hidden Markov models.

This volume will suit anybody with an interest in inference for stochastic processes, and it will be useful for researchers and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The algorithmic parts of the book do not require an advanced mathematical background, while the more theoretical parts require knowledge of probability theory at the measure-theoretical level.

“To achieve these goals, the book design emphasizes a well explained introductions to key principles and predictions. These are augmented with case studies as well as illustrations along with introductions to classical hypotheses and debates.”  (*Zentralblatt MATH*, 2012)

“The most catching aspect of Hamilton’s book is its extremely well thought-out structure and pedagogical concept. All sections are well motivated in the respective introduction and all chapters have reviews at the end. A large number of problems have been interspersed throughout the text for students to work on, and the solutions are provided at the end of each chapter. A very interesting and novel feature is the use of so-called ‘interact boxes’, which are essentially links to interactive learning and simulation software available on the internet.” *(Human Genetics, December 2009)*

{"}Hamilton's volume would be the best choice for someone seeking a thorough grounding in the subject.{"} *(The Quarterly Review of Biology, April 2010)*

{"}Both population biologists and upper-level biology students will appreciate the relatively clear explanations of exceptionally difficult material.{"} *(CHOICE, November 2009)*

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

The key to understanding population genetics is gaining familiarity with a set of traditional conceptual approaches along with classical hypotheses and debates. Armed with this background, many empirical studies will be readily understood because the basic hypotheses they address are understood from first principles. To achieve this goal, this book is designed to contain mostly conceptual material that is augmented with case studies as illustrations. Several outstanding pedagogical features including methods boxes and exercises to assist students in conducting simulations using public domain software will be integrated into the text.

    note = "\#\#\# Amazon.com Review

If Albert Einstein were alive, he would have a copy of *The Road to Reality* on his bookshelf. So would Isaac Newton. This may be the most complete mathematical explanation of the universe yet published, and Roger Penrose richly deserves the accolades he will receive for it. That said, let us be perfectly clear: this is not an easy book to read. The number of people in the world who can understand *everything* in it could probably take a taxi together to Penrose's next lecture. Still, math-friendly readers looking for a substantial and possibly even thrillingly difficult intellectual experience should pick up a copy (carefully--it's over a thousand pages long and weighs nearly 4 pounds) and start at the beginning, where Penrose sets out his purpose: to describe {"}the search for the underlying principles that govern the behavior of our universe.{"} Beginning with the deceptively simple geometry of Pythagoras and the Greeks, Penrose guides readers through the fundamentals--the incontrovertible bricks that hold up the fanciful mathematical structures of later chapters. From such theoretical delights as complex-number calculus, Riemann surfaces, and Clifford bundles, the tour takes us quickly on to the nature of spacetime. The bulk of the book is then devoted to quantum physics, cosmological theories (including Penrose's favored ideas about string theory and universal inflation), and what we know about how the universe is held together. For physicists, mathematicians, and advanced students, *The Road to Reality* is an essential field guide to the universe. For enthusiastic amateurs, the book is a project to tackle a bit at a time, one with unimaginable intellectual rewards. *--Therese Littleton*

\#\#\# From Publishers Weekly

At first, this hefty new tome from Oxford physicist Penrose (*The Emperor's New**Mind*) looks suspiciously like a textbook, complete with hundreds of diagrams and pages full of mathematical notation. On a closer reading, however, one discovers that the book is something entirely different and far more remarkable. Unlike a textbook, the purpose of which is purely to impart information, this volume is written to explore the beautiful and elegant connection between mathematics and the physical world. Penrose spends the first third of his book walking us through a seminar in high-level mathematics, but only so he can present modern physics on its own terms, without resorting to analogies or simplifications (as he explains in his preface, {"}in modern physics, one cannot avoid facing up to the subtleties of much sophisticated mathematics{"}). Those who work their way through these initial chapters will find themselves rewarded with a deep and sophisticated tour of the past and present of modern physics. Penrose transcends the constraints of the popular science genre with a unique combination of respect for the complexity of the material and respect for the abilities of his readers. This book sometimes begs comparison with Stephen Hawking's *A Brief History of Time*, and while Penrose's vibrantly challenging volume deserves similar success, it will also likely lie unfinished on as many bookshelves as Hawking's. For those hardy readers willing to invest their time and mental energies, however, there are few books more deserving of the effort. 390 illus. *(Feb. 24)*

    note = "In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write {"}something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned.{"} That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. {"}Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--{"} Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.

  
It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. {"}Her voice is full of money,{"} Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, The Great Gatsby is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.

* * *

{"}Now we have an American masterpiece in its final form: the original crystal has shaped itself into the true diamond. This is the novel as Fitzgerald wished it to be, and so it is what we have dreamed of, sleeping and waking.{"} -- James Dickey

The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set on Long Island's North Shore and in New York City during the summer of 1922.

The novel takes place following the First World War. American society enjoyed prosperity during the {"}roaring{"} 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers. After its republishing in 1945 and 1953, it quickly found a wide readership and is today widely regarded as a paragon of the Great American Novel, and a literary classic. The Great Gatsby has become a standard text in high school and university courses on American literature in countries around the world, and is ranked second in the Modern Library's lists of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.

    note = "{"}Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.{"} 

A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel—a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice—but the weight of history will only tolerate so much. 

One of the best-loved classics of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has earned many dis-tinctions since its original publication in 1960. It has won the Pulitzer Prize, been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, and been made into an enormously popular movie. It was also named the best novel of the twentieth century by librarians across the country (Library Journal). HarperCollins is proud to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the book's publication with this special hardcover edition.

“This monograph provides a comprehensive account of the development of multivariate statistical analysis powered by the explosion in the capability and speed of computers during the last four decades. It is written by an expert in the field. The book is suitable for very advanced undergraduate students and graduate students in statistics, but can also be used in a host of other areas … where statistics plays a major role. … Any researcher in multivariate statistical analysis should have this book in his personal library.” (Steen Arne Andersson, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2010 b) “…Exemplifies the transition of statistical science as a scientific discipline focused on testing to one focused on information and knowledge discovery. …Acknowledges in a novel way the link between statistical science and computer science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning theory…This book implements an overhaul for teaching multivariate analysis…” (The American Statistician, February 2010, Vol. 64 No.1)

“The author of this well-written, encyclopaedic text of roughly 730 pages highlights data mining using huge data sets and aims to blend ‘classical’ multivariate topics (such as regression, principal components and linear discriminant analysis, clustering, multi-dimensional scaling and correspondence analysis) with more recent advances from the field of computational statistics (such as classification and regression trees, neural networks, support vector machines or topics around committee machines—bagging, boosting and random forests). It is noteworthy that some of the more classical methods are derived as special cases of a common theoretical framework: reduced rank regression, a field to which Professor Izenman already has contributed with his doctoral thesis back in 1972. …Furthermore it is worth noting as well that the first chapter after the introductory overview deals with data, databases and database management—indicating the author’s seriousness about data analysis in the presence of permanently growing magnitudes of data sets to analyse. …Most chapters end with sections on software packages, and all chapters end with bibliographical notes and exercises; the final list of references contains 552 entries. …Personally, I felt the book to be heavy, yet rewarding, reading. It seems to have full potential to become a second standard reference next to Hastie et al. (2009).” (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society)

“In Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Alan Izenman attempts to synthesize multivariate methods developed across the various literatures into a comprehensive framework. The goal is to present the current state of the art  in multivariate analysis methods while attempting to place them on a firm statistical basis. …This book would be a fantastic reference for researchers interested in learning about multivariate and machine learning methods. …The first half of the book would be suitable for an advanced undergraduate or graduate multivariate analysis course. The second half of the book would be a great reference for a machine-learning course. I definitely enjoyed reading the book.”  (Biometrics, Summer 2009, 65, 990–991)

“This remarkable book exposes a wide range of techniques from the ‘statistical learning’ perspective. It is addressed to readers with a background in probability, statistical theory, multivariate calculus, linear algebra and notions of Bayesian methods. … The exercises at the end of each chapter propose both theoretical derivations and practical work with real data. … It can be used as a basis for different advanced courses. The first chapters can be employed for an introduction to modern prediction methods.” (Ricardo Maronna, Statistical Papers, Vol. 52, 2011)

\#\#\# From the Back Cover

Remarkable advances in computation and data storage and the ready availability of huge data sets have been the keys to the growth of the new disciplines of data mining and machine learning, while the enormous success of the Human Genome Project has opened up the field of bioinformatics. 

These exciting developments, which led to the introduction of many innovative statistical tools for high-dimensional data analysis, are described here in detail. The author takes a broad perspective; for the first time in a book on multivariate analysis, nonlinear methods are discussed in detail as well as linear methods. Techniques covered range from traditional multivariate methods, such as multiple regression, principal components, canonical variates, linear discriminant analysis, factor analysis, clustering, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analysis, to the newer methods of density estimation, projection pursuit, neural networks, multivariate reduced-rank regression, nonlinear manifold learning, bagging, boosting, random forests, independent component analysis, support vector machines, and classification and regression trees. Another unique feature of this book is the discussion of database management systems. 

This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers in statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology, cognitive sciences, business, medicine, bioinformatics, and engineering. Familiarity with multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics is required. The book presents a carefully-integrated mixture of theory and applications, and of classical and modern multivariate statistical techniques, including Bayesian methods. There are over 60 interesting data sets used as examples in the book, over 200 exercises, and many color illustrations and photographs.

    note = "\#\#\# From Publishers Weekly

With erudition lightly worn, Harvard historian Pipes, in this massive, wonderfully vivid, gripping chronicle, stresses the role of liberals both in the Russian revolution of 1905, for which the Communists later claimed credit, and in the upheavals of 1917. He attributes the failure of the February 1917 revolution to Alexander Kerensky's rash actions, his doctrinaire vision of democracy and his dissolution of the police and the provincial bureaucracy, which plunged the nation into anarchy. He argues persuasively that the Bolsheviks' October 1917 putsch was not a true revolution, but a classic coup d'etat. His portrayal of the backward Russian peasantry, scarcely touched by westernization, and of the intelligentsia, {"}self-appointed spokesman{"} for over nine-tenths of the populace, lays the groundwork for his discerning analysis of how Lenin built a one-party dictatorship. No other book so brilliantly clarifies the inner dynamics of the Russian Revolution. Photos.

\#\#\# From Library Journal

The author, a distinguished Harvard historian, seeks to present a comprehensive view of the Russian Revolution, tracing its roots in the half century before 1917, a period he has already examined in Russia Under the Old Regime ( LJ 3/15/75). His new book, which will also be published in the Soviet Union, should provoke lively debate in the age of glasnost, for it is an unsparing indictment of Bolshevism. Wide ranging in its coverage, based on a profound knowledge of the Russian past and of relevant Western and Soviet scholarship, the work analyzes the direction of Russian development to the Revolution (without whitewashing prerevolutionary figures such as Nicholas II), then goes on to examine the origins and entrenchment of Bolshevism, which Pipes sees as a savagely amoral force. If Soviet power in its first years brought any benefits at all, they are, in this evaluation, insignificant compared to the ghastly price paid for them by the Russian people. This is an important book.
