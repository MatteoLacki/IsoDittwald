\begin{abstract}
	This paper presents a new methodology for dealing with isotopic fine structure calculations. It aims at implementing the idea of probability-prioritised search, i.e. finding the more probable fine structure peaks before the less important ones. Such framework, to the best of our knowledge, was not yet introduced into the literature as above all exhaustive peak list enumeration methods were developed. To reduce the computational burden we base our methods on elegant Poisson approximation. Using it, we derive an ultra-fast method to determine positioning of equatransneutronic groupings of peaks. They provide a natural intermediate level of aggregation of peaks between the fine structure itself and the groupings of peaks with similar nominal masses. Using the approximation, we also develop a novel algorithm for the calculations regarding the fine structure itself.
